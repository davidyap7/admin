You can set email notifications for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} incidents and planned maintenance, and you can set spending notifications that alert you when your account is close to the spending threshold that you specified. Go to **Manage > Account > Platform Notifications** to set different notification types for your account.

## Setting platform notifications
{: #platform}

From the console menu bar, click **Manage > Account > Platform Notifications** to set email notifications for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} incidents and planned maintenance. You can select or clear each option to enable or disable the email notifications.

## Setting spending notifications
{: #spending}

If you are a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account owner, you can set up email spending notifications. Set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending, as well as spending for individual services, excluding third-party services. You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify. You can edit each spending notification at any time as your needs change.

  1. From the console menu bar, click **Manage > Account > Platform Notifications > Spending**.
  2. Enter a numeric value to set the threshold for triggering a specific type of spending notification:
    * Total account
    * Total runtime
    * Total services
    * Total container
    * Spending for a specific service
  3. Click **Save**.

If you have a Lite or Promo account, you can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account to set spending limits. For more information about Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts, see [Account types](/docs/pricing/index.html).
