# Adding accounts to your private resource
{: #include}

Any private resource you create is restricted by default. If you're a administrator for the account, you can choose who can see your resource by adding them to an includes list with the `bx` [command line interface](/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/bx_cli.html#bluemix_catalog_entry_visibility_set).

## How do I know if I have access?
{: #find-access}

You can use the CLI or the Identity and Access UI to determine whether you have access to allow users to view a private resource that has been added to the account. If you're an account owner, you can give access to a user in your account through the Identity and Access Management UI by assigning an access policy. For more information see [Managing access to your account](access.html).

## Step 1: Find your resource
{: #find-resource}

Enter `bx catalog service <service-id or service-name>`. Replace service-id or service-name with your resource name or ID. With the information that returns, you can see the hierarchy, which shows the child resources of the items in your resource.

## Step 2: Set the visibility by including an account
{: #vis-inc}

Enter the following command to allow an account to see your private resource.

`bx catalog entry-visibility-set <service-id> --includes-add <account-id or account-email>`

After the includes-add flag, you can add a comma separated list of emails or IDs associated with accounts.

After you run the command, the process to include the resource takes 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, log out and back in to your account to see the included resource.

## Remove an account from the includes list
{: #remove-exclude}

Enter the following command to remove an account from the includes list.

`bx catalog entry-visibility-set <service-id> --includes-remove <account-id or account-email>`

## Managing visibility of child objects
{: #child-vis}

You can manage the visibility of your resource or its children.

An empty includes list means only your account administrators can see it. Your account must be on the includes list for all members of the account to see it.

For example, if you enter `bx catalog service <your_service>`, you can see the resource's children.

```

You can get the resource ID for the child deployment and then include an account by using the following command. `bx catalog entry-visibility-set <service-id> â€”-includes-add <some-other-account>`.

The children of an object can inherit visibility in complex ways. If the child object is private, it has its own visibility configuration. However, if the child object is set to public, it inherits the visibility of its parent. Setting visibility on a private child object may restrict its visibility more than the parent.

For more information about how visibility works, see the [API docs](https://console.bluemix.net/apidocs/682).
